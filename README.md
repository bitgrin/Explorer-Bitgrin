# Explorer-Bitgrin

## An actually useful Mimblewimble Blockchain explorer.
Created to be used as a "HUD" of the blockchain health as well as the market price.
Justifications as well as a rough draft are included in specification.md

The completely new and foreign structure of the Bitgrin blockchain, puts a burden of being effective educators and problem solvers on our developers and community. 
This is why we decided to write a completely new explorer, that will serve as a blockchain visualizer and a HUD, educating the users about how our non-standard (non-Nakamoto) blockchain works.
